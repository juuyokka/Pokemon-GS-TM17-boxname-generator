Pokemon Gold/Silver TM17 box name generator; converts hex numbers to in-game characters for arbitrary code execution.

Assumes you are using the ["Generic Coin Case ACE setup for almost any purpose"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsIb3OZaYAs) developed by [Crystal_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQcizw_rc-q55lmwU3w6-wA). A table of relevant hex addresses and values will be added. In the meantime, you can use [Crystal_'s spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wu2v3gnqzdj1QF2thz6xGKJaObVwPkpg0VR6HCJJYp0/edit#gid=0) or [Matt's list](https://pastebin.com/y3SJ4ZqV).
